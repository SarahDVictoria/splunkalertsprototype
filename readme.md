Assuming all Splunk alerts are structured as described in https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.2.0/Alert/Webhooks,
Assuming you have a MongoDB instance running at localhost on port 27017,
A simple flask app for consuming and displaying Splunk webhook alerts should look something similar to this project.

Disclaimer:
  This is entirely untested. I didn't even run 'flask run' on it.
  This is not fit for use beyond being a prototype to get you going.
  This is not how you do a .md file.
